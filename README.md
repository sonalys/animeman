# Animeman

Animeman is a service for synchronizing your anime list currently watching with Nyaa and QBittorrent.

Currently it manages qBittorrent through it's WebUI, creating and managing a category of torrents.

It automatically parses the torrent titles for tagging the show, season and episodes, while also searching in Nyaa.si for new releases.

## Features

* **Automatic Downloads** weekly releases from your WatchList
* **Downloads batch releases**: from complete series from your WatchList
* **Tags**: all torrent entries under the configured category with [`!Serie name`, `Serie name S01E01`] as an example
* **Source and quality filter**: you can specify resolution and HEVC tag
* **Smart episode detection**: you don't need to worry about downloading the same episode twice

## How does it work?

0. Tag existing torrents in the configured category
1. Fetch your **Currently Watching** entries in **MAL** or **Anilist**
2. Search for the RSS feed for each entry in **Nyaa.si**
3. Validate if the episode / season is already present in **qBittorrent**
4. Add torrent to qBittorrent via WebUI.

The purpose of this tool is to download the latest RSS entry for each episode, so you can't prioritize quality or source for now. If you want series from one source or quality only, be sure to configure that.

## Configuration

Animeman will generate a boilerplate config for the first time.

You can set your own config path with the env `CONFIG_PATH`.

```yaml
# config.yaml
animeList:
  type: myanimelist # (myanimelist|anilist).
  username: YOUR_USERNAME # Replace with your username.
rssConfig:
  type: nyaa
  pollFrequency: 5m0s # min 1m0s.
  sources:
      - source1 # replace with your sources or remove the sources field to fetch all.
      - source2
  qualities:
      - 1080 # filter for 1080, 720, HEVC or remove to fetch all.
  customParameters:
    c: 1_2 # you can configure custom query parameters for the rss list call. In this example it will set ?c=1_2.
torrentConfig:
  type: qbittorrent
  category: Animes
  downloadPath: /downloads/animes
  createShowFolder: true # creates a folder to for the show inside downloadPath.
  renameTorrent: true # will rename the torrent in qBittorrent avoiding conflict between multiple sources with different names for the show.
  host: http://192.168.1.240:8088 # replace with your qBittorrent WebUI address.
  username: admin # replace credentials with your own
  password: adminadmin
```

## Building

### Dependencies

You will need at least go 1.22 for building the binary.

For the image you will need docker.

To build you can simply run `make build`

For the image you can run `make image`

## Roadmap

There are a couple things that will be iterated:

* Use some calendar service like anilist.co for scanning Nyaa only when close to the release date
* Improve interfaces for allowing other RSS feeds
